# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION
MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 
•Developed a machine learning model to predict Titanic survival.
<br>
•Utilized the 'pandas' and 'numpy' libraries to preprocess and clean the dataset.
<br>
•Engineered features and applied various classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to improve model performance.
<br>
•Evaluated model accuracy using cross-validation and performance metrics.
<br>
•Deployed the model using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application for real-time Titanic survival prediction.
